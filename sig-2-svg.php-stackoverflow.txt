I have spent 2 days fiddling with this code, and countless hours (months even) over past 10 years using SigPlus/SigWeb from Topaz.
And when I stumbled upon Scott's answer here, I just had to make it work. Unfortunately, @ScottG made few crucial mistakes so it didn't work out of the box, and my colleagues that tried it also failed due to lack of documentation. So my answer is 99% built on Scott's code and input, but I am adding:
- sample SigString to work with
- fixes that needed to be done
- requirements
- more comments
- SigString structure explained
- bonus code for HTML5 canvas

Anyway, since the whole story needs to be told, so I am putting the whole example here, not just the (fixed) PHP function.
If you are anxcious to just copy/paste code and move on - skip to actual code. If you want to learn how it works, read it all.

First we need to know that this code (just like Scott's from which it had been built) works only if SigString is neither compressed nor encrypted. If you have previous database of signatures, it's time to convert those to uncompressed/unencrypted ones. This is first step, and reason why others gave up on Scott's code right away. Unfortunately explaining compression/decompression is out of scope of this answer, and does need Windows OS + SigWeb or SigPlus, so please consult official docs at https://www.topazsystems.com/software/download/sigweb.pdf . I did not try to reverse compression format, it is possible Topaz just uses something like zip/gzip/bzip etc, but I didn't have more time (for now), so to make my life easier I just converted sample of (compressed) SigStrings I was given from SetSigCompressionMode(1) ("1" = Lossless compression at a 4 to 1 ratio) to SetSigCompressionMode(0) (no compression) using SigWeb and Windows machine. Again, you HAVE TO use no compression if you want to make it work with this code! Same goes for encryption I guess, if you use Topaz SigWeb/SigPlus built-in encryption, you'd be advised to decrypt the database once, and in future use your own encryption code. On to the samples now.

Here is example SigString generated with Topaz tablet, saved by using SetSigCompressionMode(1) ("1" = Lossless compression at a 4 to 1 ratio):

This is same SigString converted to SetSigCompressionMode(0) (no compression):

Bonus: If you really need to save space on disk/in database use this instead of built-in SigWeb/SigPlus compression, this is same example SigString that was uncompressed, and then compressed using PHP's built-in gzdeflate function, you actually get even smaller output this way:

Now, I want to explain the SigString format (base on my sample SigString).
Below is output of raw string, right after hex2bin conversion (cropped for readability):

197
4
451 481
450 480
450 479
450 477
450 474
451 470
451 464
452 458
...
787 229
773 227
763 225
758 223
756 223
756 223
0
41
93
120

Note we actually have 4 segments here:
- line 1 (sample: 197) is amount of coordinates or "points" we have in our signature file, those are number pairs that will start at line 3
- line 2 (sample: 4) is number of lines we have, or better said, number of breaking points we keep, and those are single-number entries at very end of file (in this sample: 0/41/93/120)
- line 3 onwards we have all those (197) lines with coordinate pairs, logically, this will be as small or as long of a list as your signature actually has. To make it absolutely clear, if line 1 said "5" you would have just 5 pairs, if line 1 said 2999 you'd have 2999 pairs
- at end of file we finally have segment with list of those breaking points or end-points that were enumerated by line 2. Again, if line 2 said "3" you would have 3 single-number lines at end of your file, if line 2 said "899" then you would have huge list of 899 single-number lines at end of your file.

As you see from this description, we need to read those first two lines to get started. Later in Scott's code those will be array members, thats arr[0] and arr[1].
Using those two numbers, we can slice the signature into two arrays, one with coordinate pairs, and other with lines, or more correctly - line endings. You slice it in a number of ways, just keep in mind the format of Sigstring layout.

Using this example we first split the hex2bin result into array, based on provided sample SigString:

Then slice that array into one array containing just "coords" values (note that from original array we ommit first two elements that were just descriptors, and number of elements in new array is as long as first element of original array said it will be):

And we finish slicing by creating one other array containing "lines" values (again, length of this array is to be cut as long as second element of original array says to):
["0","41","93","120"]

Now, in the code you will see I made a fix, so my actuall "lines[]" array prints this:
["0","41","93","120","197"]
Note that my code-fix added that "197" there at end. That isn't in original signature's end, right? But we still know that from signature's first line, we know it has 197 points, so I just concatenated that to array.
Why do that?

Our example signature is simple two letters - "AP" - and has just 4 lines:
- coordinates 0 through 41
- coordinates 42 through 93
- coordinates 94 through 120
- and... 121 through 197

That last one isn't clearly described, as it should be obvious, it simply goes from previous line's end (120 + 1) till end of coordinate list.
But, well, depending how you do the following steps, your code may or may not need that "197" in lines[] array. For original code to be fixed with minimum changes we need that '197' to be there in array, so that foreach loop can write that last line correctly.
We could've fixed it in several obvious ways:
- if it is last element in for-each, do different code that uses $done + $arr[0]
- we could not need the "lines" as such at all, as you will see in my bonus "HTML5 canvas" code, you don't actually define line start/end as in SVG, you just move your pencil, but sometimes it's moved "on paper" sometimes "in the air"
- etc
As explained, you just need to make sure you use all of your coordinates, and to correct original code this was the easiest way (one-liner) without a more through rewrite.

Knowing what we have now, Scott elected for a solution that included another slicing code. He is slicing our coords[] array to separate lines, well, polylines, that he later outputs to SVG. Due to SVG's format, this is actually the prefered way, or at least I see it as such when looking at how Scott did it and what SVG actually looks like inside HTML as end product.
But unfortunately, original code had 2 mistakes (that took me 2 days to solve :) ).
One mistake was lacking that last line, and depending on your sample signature it may not be obvious. My first sample had just a dot (signature with "i" letters, so whoever signed it did the dots on the "i" literally at the end, so it wasn't noticable at all, just one dot missing). But this "AP" sample I am providing here actually has whole letter "P" as last line, so missing whole letter made it quite obvious. Anyway, I explained how I fixed that so moving on to second issue.
The other bug was that wrong value was used for slice lengths when slicing to segments/polylines. It actually used the last point to slice it, but array_slice PHP function expects (array, starting point, length) and Scott probably expected it to be (array, starting point, ending point). This too was subtle in some signature samples. What essentially happened was some of the points being re-used, but if you write a line on top of a line, it doesn't matter (specially in perfect digital drawing). But! by re-using coordinates, it sometimes extended one line over the path of two or more lines combined, essentially negating what was ment to happen when "pen" was "in the air", and suddenly all signatures looked as if pen was never removed from paper. Eg. the "dot" on the "i" would be a line connecting "i" and the "dot" (or worse even if you wrote "line" and dotted your "i" after last letter, it would connect the dot with "e", now that's making it pop out)

I fixed that, so now it slices something like this (based on output of my example SigString again):
line = 1 , linevalue = 41 , done = 0 , linelength = 41
line = 2 , linevalue = 93 , done = 41 , linelength = 52
line = 3 , linevalue = 120 , done = 93 , linelength = 27
line = 4 , linevalue = 197 , done = 120 , linelength = 77

I left my sample uncompressed SigString in the code, as well as whole bunch of echos commented out in the code, if you uncomment those you will see this whole process laid out in front of you step by step. And if you comment/uncomment parts of fixed code, you will see same with Scott's version as well, to compare.

I made comments at lines I added, and if it was a change od Scott's line I left his line commented right above my fixed line so you can compare easily.
I did not mark all mine vs. his comments, as those can be skipped anyway, my comments just supplement the explanation or explain my changes.

Here is also a link to my GitHub repo, so you can see code there as well.
If it's not working for you please leave a comment here or raise an issue at GitHub.

Now on to code finally, sorry it took this long. You can just copy/paste whole thing to http://phpfiddle.org/ to see it in action

OK, done with PHP ... but there is one more bonus for you folks!
I re-used same PHP code to actually draw the signature in HTML5 canvas, similar as the original SigWeb component does, but without using Topaz APIs/components.
I've re-used the PHP code to do the initial hex2bin and slicing
It is somewhat shorter this way, though not as polished as Scott's SVG.
Tested, works all nice even on combination of Ubuntu / Apache / PHP web server, with Android phone as client, so no Windows involved.

					if (lines.includes(String(i)))
						{
							context.moveTo(coordx, coordy);
						}
					//	otherwise, we DRAW the line between points on canvas, using lineTo() that coordinate
					else
						{
							context.lineTo(coordx, coordy);
						}
				}

			//	at the end we have to define the color of the signature in the canvas
			context.strokeStyle = "#000000";	//	black
			//	and the thickness of the line, as you feel appropriate
			context.lineWidth = "3";
			//	and finally tell browser to make our lines into stroke, which is effectively command that shows signature in the canvas
			context.stroke();

			//	this ends client-side code, and we need just some basic HTML markup to execute it

<div style="color:red; font-size:25px;" onclick="javascript:cCanvas()">Click to show signature</div>
<br>
Canvas is below, press button to show signature:
<br>
<canvas name="c" id="c" height="600" width="1500" ></canvas>
<br>

<!--
Canvas is fixed size, which is the unpolished part. You MAY have signature larger or smaller than this canvas. If you need, expand canvas till your signature fits.
If someone feels like it, you could make code similar to what's in PHP example, and search for min/max of X and Y coordinates, then fit the signature inside.
I spent 2 days on this project, so I'm good for now, but if we decide to use canvas and make the appropriate code I will edit this answer.
